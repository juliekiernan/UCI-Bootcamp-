    "- Charter schools outperformed District schools across all categories.  This could be due to many factors: class size, teaching style, classroom environment, and class content of courses to name a few.  Additional information would need to be provided to confirm.\n",
    "- There was little discernable difference between scores of 9th graders and 12th graders.  This would seem to indicate that the success of a student is determined before they enter the 9th grade.  This could be a window of opprtunity to improve passing scores in Reading and Mathematics for the school.  If at risk/ low performing students are identified both before entry to and during the 9th grade and are provided with additional resources and educational support in these areas, their growth would ultimately contribute to the overall success for the school.\n",
    "- Budget seemed to have little correlation to student success.  This could be in part to the loss of economies of gain; the larger the student population, the greater the cost of non-acedemic costs such as electricity, administration, real estate rent/ taxes, or student safety equipment.  Additional information on the breakdown of how school budgets are spent would be needed to confirm."
